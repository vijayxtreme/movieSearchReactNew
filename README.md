# Movie Search App Using React - Updated for 2020

This is an updated codebase to the original Movie Search React App I presented at [JavaScriptLA](https://javascriptla.net) in 2016 at General Assembly in DTLA.

You can check out the original slides via [https://slides.com/javascriptla/intro-to-react]

I'm redoing all my old code tutorials to be more updated and to reference via [YouTube.com/JavaScriptLA](https://youtube.com/javascriptla).  Feel free to make a pull request if you see anything that might be of concern or error.  Appreciate the help! 

For all React newbie developers, be sure to check out this tutorial as it's a great deep dive into the world of React, especially functional components, props, state, class components and fetch API with ES6.
